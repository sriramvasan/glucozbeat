                        The <span className="text-purple-700"> Glycemic Index (GI)</span>  is a
                        system that rates carbohydrate-containing foods by how much they
                        raise blood glucose levels compared to a standard food.
                    </p>
                    <p>The GI scale runs from 0 to 100:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                <strong>Low GI (55 or less)</strong>: These foods are slowly
                                digested and absorbed, causing a slower and smaller rise in
                                blood sugar levels.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Medium GI (56 to 69)</strong>: These foods cause a
                                moderate increase in blood sugar levels.
                            </p>

                                <strong>High GI (70 or above)</strong>: These foods cause a
                                quicker and higher spike in blood sugar levels.
                            </p>

                        Foods <span className="text-purple-700">high in refined carbs and sugar </span>
                        are digested more quickly and
                        often have a high GI, while foods high in protein, fat, or fibre
                        typically have a low GI. Foods that contain no carbs are not
                        assigned a GI and include meat, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds, herbs,
                        spices, and oils.

                    <p>
                        Low GI foods are beneficial as they help manage blood glucose
                        levels, reduce cholesterol, and keep you feeling full longer. They
                        are particularly crucial for managing conditions like <span className="text-purple-700">

                            is a way to see how much a certain food
                            can raise your blood sugar. Foods with a <span className="text-purple-700">higher GI number make
                            your blood sugar rise more quickly</span>, while foods with a lower GI
                            have a smaller, slower effect.

                        Choosing low-GI foods can have several benefits, especially for
                        managing health and energy levels:

                                <strong>Better Blood Sugar Control</strong>: Low-GI foods help
                                stabilize blood glucose levels by preventing rapid spikes, which
                                is crucial for managing GDM effectively.

                                more consistent source of energy, helping you stay active and
                                energized throughout the day.

                    <p>
                        Even though a food is labeled low-GI, it&#39;s important to consider
                        its overall nutritional profile. For instance, some low-GI foods may
                        be high in fats or sugars. Here are some tips to incorporate low-GI
                        foods into your diet healthily:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Pair Carbohydrates with Proteins or Fats</strong>:
                                Combining foods can often help lower the overall GI of a meal.
                                For example, add nuts or yogurt to your diet to balance the GI.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Choose Whole and Less Processed Foods</strong>: Whole
                                grains like brown rice or whole wheat roti have a lower GI than
                                their processed counterparts.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Be Mindful of Ripeness and Preparation</strong>: The GI
                                of fruits and vegetables can change based on ripeness and how
                                they are cooked. Less ripe and less processed usually means a
                                lower GI.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Control Portions</strong>: Even low-GI foods can impact
                                your blood sugar if eaten in large quantities. Watch your
                                portion sizes to keep your blood glucose levels in check.
